"""Schema step 5: what a version-4 database becomes.

One change: `messages` gains an `attachments` column — the turn's
pictures, a plain JSON list naming files in the folder beside the
database. Appended after the last column, because the record format is
positional and existing rows must read NULL there, not shift their
trailing values into it (and before the table constraints, where SQLite
wants a column); only text changes, so the table is rewritten in place
under `writable_schema` — step 4's procedure, its helpers copied here
because a step's helpers are frozen with it, shared with no sibling.
