"""Schema step 8: what a version-7 database becomes.

One change, two constraints widened. `messages.role` admits 'tool' and
`messages.kind` admits 'tool': the row a tool otaku runs leaves — its
result, nobody's line — beside the reader's and the model's. No row
changes: a constraint widened is one every existing row already
satisfies, so the stored DDL is rewritten under `writable_schema` by
step 5's procedure, its helpers copied here because a step's helpers
are frozen with it.
